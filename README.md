# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### About the project

1. The project is developed using react, redux is used here for state management, redux saga to handle middleware calls.
2. Used basic CSS and CSS5, not used any external design systems. The project can be improved using SCSS.
3. Axios library is used to make async api calls.
4. Tried to achieve responsiveness in the application, however, it can be improved further.
5. The api url is present in .env.development file.
6. The application is hosted locally, so, local development server is necessary to be started.
7. Tried to achieve look and feel similar to the example shared, with few modification to make the application better.
8. Achieved grid view for products, client side filters on category and text to search feature.
9. The products dynamically renders on change in filters.
10. Added loader for the time till the products are loaded from server.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
